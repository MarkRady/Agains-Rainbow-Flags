<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarkRady/Agains-Rainbow-Flags/master/images/icon.png" alt="demo"></p>

## Features
  - Normalize Rainbow Logos For Brands
  - Support Linkedin in first version

## Idea
Many people annoyed about changes that's happend in many websites like linkedin. because they changed their logo to rainbow. 
So this extension will automatically normalize any website in app list to default logo.
So here we can take an action about this changes.


Contributions are more than welcome.
